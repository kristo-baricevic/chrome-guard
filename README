# Chrome Guard

Chrome Guard is a small desktop helper that:

- Launches Google Chrome with a low latency profile and flags
- Monitors Chrome CPU usage in the background
- Shows live meters for Chrome CPU usage
- Logs alerts when a specific Chrome process (GPU, tab renderer, extension, and so on) causes sustained spikes

It uses a Tkinter UI so you can type a URL and open Chrome from the app instead of the CLI.
